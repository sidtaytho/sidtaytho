I’m Dr. Sidney Thomas, an I-O psychologist and people analytics consultant based in Austin, Texas. I work as a Senior Consultant in Advanced Analytics at Allstate, where I use data to help organizations make more informed, human-centered decisions. I earned my Ph.D. in Industrial-Organizational Psychology in 2024, and my work sits at the intersection of behavioral science, statistics, and strategy.
