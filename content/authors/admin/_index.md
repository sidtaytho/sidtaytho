Sidney Thomas is a doctoral candidate of Industrial-Organizational Psychology at Louisiana Tech University. She is currently serving as the Student Director of Applied Research for Organizational Solutions ([AROS](https://www.arosconsulting.org/)), where she initiated and developed an organizational transition alongside faculty and fellow AROS leadership. Her experience with current and prior consulting projects is quite diverse, as she has managed teams through climate survey data analyses, NSF grant evaluations, and generating dashboard reports in Rmarkdown for Kansas public schools. Her research endeavors have resulted in six successful leadership institutes across the university and a Louisiana nonprofit organization, as well as some individual leadership counseling. Currently, she is working with NSF's iChange grant at LA Tech to gauge and implement campus policies related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This project envelopes her dissertation, which focuses on motivation and organizational readiness to change. Lastly, she serves as the graduate student representative for the University's Inclusive Excellence Advisory Council.
